This repository contains data and scripts to generate plots contained in the preprint: Nic Ezzell, Lev Barash, Itay Hen, Exact and universal quantum Monte Carlo estimators for energy susceptibility and fidelity susceptibility (2024).

# Requirements
Plots are generated using python Jupyter lab notebooks with the following library dependencies
- `jupyterlab`
- `seaborn`
- `pandas`
- `scipy`
- `numpy`

# Brief expalantion
Raw data is contained in `data/`, and each csv has a descriptive title. Scripts to analyze the data and make plots are contained in `plot_scripts/`, and these again have descriptive titles that refer to which figures are generated by which scripts. Generating plots for [preprint] is as simply as running each Jupyter cell in order. 

The only exception to this is `plot_scripts/before_fig2_post_selection.ipynb` which contains scripts that analyze which of the random 100--spin models has the highest signs. No figures from this are actually used in [preprint], and instead, the important output of this are the random seeds that generate the 10 models with the highest signs. These are output after the relevant section header.
